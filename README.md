# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset. Preprocessed data by cleaning, normalizing, and splitting into training/testing sets. Trained and evaluated models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, achieving high performance with XGBoost. Visualized results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Features
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Visualization of results
